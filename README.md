# E-Learning Portal
​
Overview:
For my final project with Tech Elevator, I co-created a full-stack E-Learning Portal that allows teachers and students to create and sign up for courses, view course details and course progress, assign and submit homework assignments, grade and manage their learning online.

Tech Stack:
Java, PostgreSQL, CSS, HTML, JavaScript along with Spring Boot and Vue.js frameworks, DAO and MVC pattern, RESTFul API, and Git to collaborate with a team of four.

Special thanks to my project partners Kyoko Inagawa, Brian Beam and Ivy Yang for all they taught throughout the project!
